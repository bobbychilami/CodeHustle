We will be creating our mini project in this Repository.

1. First of all we are creating a Learning Web Application.
2. Everyone try to create your own designs in your Android Studio and then commit it to this Repo.
3. If you are facing any problems let us know in the whatsapp group.
4. We are going to add as many features as we can, but first we will create a full fledged offline learing app.
5. We are adding a discuss section.
